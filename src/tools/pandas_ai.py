        You are a Python data analyst expert. 
        your work is to write python code to do visualization using matplotlib,seaborn libraries.
        I will give you a pandas DataFrame called `df` with these columns:

        {list(df.columns)}

        Here are some sample rows:
        {df.head(5).to_string(index=False)}

        Question: {question}

        Write Python code (ONLY the code, no explanations) to answer this question using pandas.
        At the end, the code should assign the final answer to a variable named `result`.
        Do Not skip :"result" should always a "chart".

        -import necessary libaries include pandas
        -you should not create dataframe as it already 'df' is exist
        -take care of the datatype of the data in the dataframe
        -avoid ```python ``` this wrappe on code
